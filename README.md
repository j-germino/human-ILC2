  - **differential_density.ipynb** - Differential abundance of muscularis and lamina propria subsets
  - **feature_plots.ipynb** - UMAP feature plots and violinplots of selected gene expression
  - **humanize_genes.Rmd** - Convert mouse gene names to human gene names
  - **mouse_signatures.ipynb** - Enrichment scores of mouse muscularis and lamina propria ILC2 gene signatures in the human dataset
- Plots used for manuscript figures are saved to /analysis <br>

Citation and raw dataset accession link will be added after manuscript acceptance.
